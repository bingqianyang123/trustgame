        Instructions
    </h3>

    <P>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant to join an online trust game experiment.
        As part of the experiment, one of you will be selected at random to be Participant A whereas
        the other will be Participant B.
        You will be informed which participant you have been assigned as prior to making any decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment begins with Participant A having {{ C.ENDOWMENT }};
        Participant B having nothing.
        Participant A can send none, some, or all of
        their {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} to Participant B.
        Before Participant B receives the amount from Participant A, it will be multiplied
        by {{ C.MULTIPLIER }}. Once Participant B receives
        the tripled amount, they can decide to return none, some, or all of it to Participant A.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the purpose of this experiment, each point is worth â‚¬1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before this experiment,
        each of you has received a table summarzing the decisions of the previous 10 pairs of experimenters
        who had participated in the this experiment last week.
