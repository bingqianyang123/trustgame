        Instructions
    </h3>
    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        One of you will be selected at random to be participant A;
        the other will be participant B.
        You will learn whether you are participant A or B prior to making any
        decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        To start, participant A receives {{ C.ENDOWMENT }};
        participant B receives
        nothing.
        Participant A can send some or all of
        his {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} to participant B.
        Before B receives this amount, it will be multiplied
        by {{ C.MULTIPLIER }}. Once B receives
        the tripled amount he can decide to send some or all of it to
        A.

        You chose to send participant B {{ group.sent_amount }}.
        Participant B returned {{ group.sent_back_amount }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        You were initially endowed with {{ C.ENDOWMENT }},
        chose to send {{ group.sent_amount }},
        received {{ group.sent_back_amount }}
        thus you now have:
        {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}-{{ group.sent_amount }}+{{ group.sent_back_amount }}=<strong>{{ player.payoff }}</strong>
    </p>
{{ else }}
    <p>
        Participant A sent you {{ group.sent_amount }}.
        They were tripled so you received {{ tripled_amount }}.
        You chose to return {{ group.sent_back_amount }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        You received {{ tripled_amount }},
        chose to return {{ group.sent_back_amount }}
        thus you now have:
        ({{ tripled_amount }})-({{ group.sent_back_amount }})=<strong>{{ player.payoff }}</strong>
