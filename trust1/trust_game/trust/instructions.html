    <p>
        You have been asked to participate in an online economics experiment.
        You can complete this experiment in 3-4 minutes.
        Please be available for the entire duration of the experiment, until you reach the final result.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this experiment, each of you will be randomly and anonymously paired with another participant to join an online trust game experiment.
        You will not be told who these people are either during or after the experiment
        Next, as part of the experiment,
        one of you will be selected at random to be Participant A whereas the other will be Participant B.
        You will be informed which Participant you have been assigned as prior to making any decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment begins with Participant A having {{ C.ENDOWMENT }};
        Participant B having
        nothing.
        Participant A can send none, some, or all of
        their {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} to Participant B.
        Before Participant B receives the amount from Participant A, it will be multiplied
        by {{ C.MULTIPLIER }}. Once Participant B receives
        the tripled amount, they can decide to return none, some, or all of it to
        Participant A.
        For the purpose of this experiment, each point is worth â‚¬1.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you have all completed your decisions, this experiment is over.
        Then, your private results will be calculated automatically and you can find them on the last page.
        Your answers will be used for research purposes only and you will remain completely anonymous.
