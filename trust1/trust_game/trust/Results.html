        You chose to send Participant B {{ group.sent_amount }}.
        Participant B returned {{ group.sent_back_amount }}.

        You were initially endowed with {{ C.ENDOWMENT }},
        chose to send {{ group.sent_amount }},
        received {{ group.sent_back_amount }}
        thus you now have:
        {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}-{{ group.sent_amount }}+{{ group.sent_back_amount }}=<strong>{{ player.payoff }}</strong>.

        Participant A sent you {{ group.sent_amount }}.
        They were tripled so you received {{ tripled_amount }}.
        You chose to return {{ group.sent_back_amount }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        You received {{ tripled_amount }},
        chose to return {{ group.sent_back_amount }}
        thus you now have:
        ({{ tripled_amount }})-({{ group.sent_back_amount }})=<strong>{{ player.payoff }}</strong>.
